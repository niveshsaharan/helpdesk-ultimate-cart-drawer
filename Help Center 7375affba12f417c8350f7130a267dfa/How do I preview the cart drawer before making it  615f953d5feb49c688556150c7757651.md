# How do I preview the cart drawer before making it live for public?

Disable the app for both desktop and mobile from the settings page by clicking Disable in front of `Desktop Settings` and `Mobile Settings`

Once the app is disable, no one can see the cart drawer on your store. To see it in action, just open your store and append a query string `?ucd=1` to the end of URL. 

Suppose your store domain is [https://my-awesome-store-url.com](#) and you want to preview the cart drawer on home page, you will open it with the url [https://my-awesome-store-url.com](https://my-awesome-store-url.com/)?ucd=1

### More examples:

[https://my-awesome-store-url.com/products/my-custom-product?ucd=1](https://my-awesome-store-url.com/products/my-custom-product?ucd=1)

[https://my-awesome-store-url.com/products/my-custom-product?variant=some-id-here&ucd=1](https://my-awesome-store-url.com/products/my-custom-product?variant=some-id-here&ucd=1)

[https://my-awesome-store-url.com/collections/my-collections?ucd=1](https://my-awesome-store-url.com/collections/my-collections?ucd=1)

By adding `open-ucd=1` in the url, the cart drawer will be opened automatically.
